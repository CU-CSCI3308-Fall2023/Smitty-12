Test plan: 
Unit Testing: Mocha and Chai
Test cases: Login, Register,
Test environment: VS Code, Google Chrome, Node 
User Acceptance Testers: 
Login:
	Positive Test Case :  The user should be able to successfully login to the website if their login credentials are valid. 
This test is to ensure that the login function works as we intended and users are able to gain access to the other features of the website.

Expected Test Result: Should send a redirect status 302 if credentials are actually stored.

	Negative Test Case : Checks to make sure that our system correctly handles incomplete login submissions for users attempting to login. 
The goal is the user cannot login without first providing all essential information which would be the username and password.

Expected Test Result: The user should see an error message and the page should stay on login.

Register:
	Positive Test Case: This test case is to confirm that a user can successfully register a new account into the database, if the register is successful then the user 
should be redirected to the login page. This test case is designed to check if someone is actually inserting a new account into our database of users. 

Expected Test Result: The user is redirected to the login page so they can login once the registration is successful.

	Negative Test Case: The goal of this test case is to ensure the system properly handles the case of a user registering with a username that already exists in the
database. The user should be prompted to enter a new username or password and the page does not redirect to the login page until a unique username is provided.

Expected Test Result: The system should stay on the register page with an error about duplicate usernames showing up.
