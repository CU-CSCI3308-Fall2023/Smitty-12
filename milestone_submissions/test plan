Test plan: 
Unit Testing: Mocha and Chai
Test cases: Login, Register,
Test environment: VS Code, Google Chrome, Node 
Login:
	Positive Test Case : Should send a redirect status 302 if credentials are actually stored. The goal of this test case is to 
successfully login in an account that already exist in the database.

	Negative Test Case: A user cannot submit a form without completing all fo the mandatory fields to include Username, Password.
This should not allow you to login and not redirect to the discover page.

Register:
	Positive Test Case: Should redirect to the login page if you successfully register a new account into the database.
This test case is designed to check if someone is actually inserting a new account into our database of users. 

	Negative Test Case: Should remain on the Register field and need to enter a new username or password. Will not redirect to 
login page.  The goal of this test case is to proper know our filtering process works. I.E. if a username already exist do not allow 
duplication.
